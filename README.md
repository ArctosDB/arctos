# Arctos
Initialized from automatically exported from code.google.com/p/arctos 26 Aug 2015.

### Arctos is a collection management system for natural and cultural history museums and collections. [Current public code releases are posted here](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos-dev). This repo functions as the user forum for issues.

Arctos is an ongoing effort to integrate access to specimen and object data, collection-management tools, and external resources on the Web. Nearly all that is known about a cataloged item can be included in Arctos, and, except for some data encumbered for proprietary reasons, data are open to the public.

Access Arctos: [https://arctos.database.museum/](https://arctos.database.museum/home.cfm)
