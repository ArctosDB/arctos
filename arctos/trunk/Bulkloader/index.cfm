<h2>Bulkloading Specimens</h2>

There are 2 online methods by which you may bulkload specimens. 
<ul>
	<li>
		The <a href="/Bulkloader/BulkloadSpecimens.cfm">INSERT-based application</a>
		 will handle about 1000 records. This application
		is entirely ColdFusion, and is generally more stable and easier to debug 
		than the SQLLDR application. It accepts CSV files. We highly recommend
		it's usage when possible.
	</li>
	<li>
		The <a href="/Bulkloader/bulkloaderLoader.cfm">SQLLDR-based application</a>
		 will theoretically handle any number of records, 
		and calls an Oracle application to insert a text file into the bulkloader table.
		Practical use is limited by your upload speed and serverside preprocessing time.
		This method can be used for ca. 10,000 records on a good connection. It's also very picky,
		potentially hard to debug, requires tab-delimited text files, 
		and can have issues with non-ASCII characters when called from 
		Web application.
	</li>
	<li>
		Large datasets may be impossible to load without DBA assistance due to network speeds and timeout
		settings, and your browser's ability to handle very large text files. Contact a DBA if you're having 
		trouble with the above methods.
	</li>
</ul>
