This file serves as a guide for moving files from subversion into a working copy.

Special Folders:

folder /log should exist on the server but not in subversion. 
File /log/UnauthAccess.log records user access level violations and should not be shared between institutions.

/manual is a ColdFusion folder and does not need to be shared.

/META-INF is a ColdFusion folder and does not need to be shared.

/WEB-INF is a ColdFusion folder and does not need to be shared.

/_mmServerScripts is a ColdFusion folder and does not need to be shared.

/mrtg is a ColdFusion folder and does not need to be shared.

{lower(institution_acronym) + _ + lower(collection_cde)} (eg, "uam_mamm") folders are generated by a CFScheduler job and 
	do not necessarily need to be shared. However, we'll bring them along for now to prevent their non-existence
	until the cron job runs
	
/site_maps.xml is a Google tool that is institution-specific and should not be shared.

/SpecimenImages is a site-specific directory and should not be shared.
