Arctos is an ongoing effort to integrate access 
to specimen data, collection-management tools, and 
external resources on the Web.  
Nearly all that is known about a specimen can be 
included in Arctos, and, except for some data 
encumbered for proprietary reasons, data are open to the public.
</p>
<p><strong >Features:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Vaporware-free since 2001. All this stuff, and much more, really exists in a usable state, and we'll never claim
		proposed or limited funtionality exists.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="MediaSearch.cfm">Media</a> links images, moves, sound files, and documents to 
		specimens, taxonomy, publications, projects, events, or people.
		<br>
		Multi-page documents organize, paginate, and print PDFs of scanned media such as field notes.
		<br>
		TAGs comment on or relate specific areas of images to nodes such as specimens, places, and people.
	</li>
	<li>
		User feedback concerning specimens, taxonomy, projects, publications, and media.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/obe/obe10gdb/security/vpd/vpd.htm" target="_blank" class="external">
		Virtual Private Databases</a> (VPD), also known as Row-Level Security (RLS), allow collections to maintain
		control of their data while sharing certain nodes, such as Agents and Taxonomy. The cool kids call this 
		Cloud Computing or Grid Computing.
	</li>
	<li>Everything is over the web in real time, and 
		independent of client-side operating systems. 
		You need moderate bandwidth, a modern browser, 
		and nothing more.</li>
	<li>Specimen-search screen is user-customizable 
		to about 100 search terms.  
		Find specimens by project, publication, usage, taxonomy, spatial attributes, and much more.  
		Save and e-mail  searches.</li>
	<li>Customizable table for result sets,	summarize 
		and graph result sets, download (as text, CSV, or XML), map in 
		<a href="http://berkeleymapper.berkeley.edu"  target="_blank" class="external">BerkeleyMapper</a>,

		for
		<a href="http://earth.google.com/"  target="_blank" class="external">Google Earth</a>.
	</li>
	<li>Customizable by individual collection using 
		headers and footers of their own design, and CSS.</li>
	<li>Any catalog item can have any number of attributes, 
		and attributes are customized to collections.</li>
	<li>Reciprocal linkages with external resources 
		(<a href="http://berkeleymapper.berkeley.edu"  target="_blank" class="external">BerkeleyMapper</a>,

		and <a href="http://www.morphbank.net/"  target="_blank" class="external">MorphBank</a>).</li>
	<li>Identifications can be formulaic combinations 
		of terms drawn from a separate taxonomic authority.</li>
	<li>Maintains history of determinations for taxonomic 
		identifications, georeferencing, and biological attributes.</li>
	<li>Specimen records, specimen parts, attributes, 
		citations, and much more can be entered or edited individually 
		or in batches.</li>
	<li>Object-tracking using nested-containers model, 
		bar codes, and container-condition history.</li>
	<li>
		E-mail <a href="http://arctosblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/suspect-data.html">reminders</a> for loans due, 
		permit expirations, etc. Intelligent reports detailing possible GenBank matches,
		missing citations, unlikely publications, and various other potentially faulty or missing data. 
	</li>
	<li>Encumbrances can mask localities, collector names, 
		or entire records from unprivileged users.</li>
	<li>Design and print labels, reports, transaction documents, etc. with a

Arctos is currently two systems sharing the same code. 
One is a 
<a href="http://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenSearch.cfm" target="_blank">multi-hosting version</a> 
that includes collections 
at the 
<a href="http://www.uaf.edu/museum" target="_blank">University of Alaska Museum of the North</a>, 
the 
<a href="http://www.msb.unm.edu/" target="_blank">University of New Mexico's Museum of Southwestern Biology</a>,  
<a href="http://www.wnmu.edu/" target="_blank">Western New Mexico State University</a>, and
the 
<a href="http://mvz.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Museum of Vertebrate Zoology</a>. A second server at the
<a href="http://mczbase.mcz.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology</a> hosts 
MCZ's Herp collection, with more collections coming soon.</p>

<p>Arctos is rooted in the 
<a href="http://mvz.berkeley.edu/cis/index.html" target="_blank">Collections Information System</a> at MVZ.  
Development efforts are being shared, 
and programming is freely available.</p>

<p>Collections or institutions interested in having their 
data hosted in Arctos, or interested in participating in 
the development of Arctos should <cfoutput><a href="mailto:#application.technicalEmail#">contact us</a></cfoutput>.</p>

<p><a name="faq"><strong>FAQ</strong></a><br/>

<div class="q">
	Q: Are these live data?
</div>
<div class="a">
	A: Almost. Live data are stored in a <a href="http://arctos.googlecode.com/files/Arctos_1page.pdf" class="external" target="_blank">
	highly normalized relational structure</a> - fabulous for 
	organization, not so hot for query. Some data are then optimized for 
	query performance by way of Database Triggers. Presentation data are generally less than one minute stale.
</div>
<div class="q">
	Q: Is there a limit on the number of records I can return in a search?
</div>
<div class="a">
	A: We impose no strict limits. Queries almost always take less than 5 seconds. Getting the data to your browser often then
	becomes a bottleneck. If you have a reasonably fast browser and connection, it should be possible to return 
	at least 100,000 basic records with a single query. We have no idea why you'd want to. <a href="info/bugs.cfm" target="_blank">Let us know</a> 
	if you find something excessively slow.
</div>
<div class="q">
	Q: What's a VPD?
</div>
<div class="a">
	A: A Virtual Private Database allows us to share resources, like programmers and hardware, along with some data,
	such as Taxonomy and Agents. We all end up with more than we could afford by ourselves, and operators generally can't tell that
	they're in a shared environment.
</div>
<div class="q">
	Q: What's Media? Can I store images or video in Arctos?
</div>
<div class="a">
	Media, loosely defined, is anything you can produce a URI for. Web pages, Internet-accessible images, and 
	documents stored on FTP sites are all potentially Media. Media may form relationships with any "node" in Arctos.
	<br>
	Arctos proper offers little in the way of storage. However, we have a partnership with the
	<a href="http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/" class="external" target="_blank">
	Texas Advanced Computing Center</a> which provides us access to essentially unlimited storage space. Arctos currently
	links to around 10 terabytes of Media, primarily high-resolution images of ALA herbarium sheets and historical MVZ images, both
	on TACC's servers.	
</div>
<div class="q">
	Q: Why Oracle and ColdFusion?
</div>
<div class="a">
	Because they work. We've tried many other solutions along the way. Oracle is rock-solid and stable, and allows us to 
	do things like share/control data via VPDs, maintain current data to our query environments, and 
	sleep at night. ColdFusion is a very robust rapid development environment that fits our programming style perfectly 
	while providing very close to 100% uptime and reliability. On a more practical level, implementing an open-source solution 
	would necessitate hiring at least one additional person to mange software, while compromising stability
	and security.
</div>
<div class="q">
	Q: How does Arctos compare with Specify?	
</div>
<div class="a">
	While sharing a common ancestor, Arctos and Specify now differ almost every level - software, 
	hardware, security model, data model, 
	development strategy, and support community. A <a href="/info/avs.html">comparison</a> is available.
</div>
<div class="q">
	Q: What about security and backups?	
</div>
<div class="a">
	Arctos has multiple levels of security. A lightweight application security package controls access to forms, while Oracle
	partitions data by user, roles, and context, and provides auditing. Incremental backup logs are maintained on mirrored disks, 
	and daily backups are maintained in 3 geographically separate secure locations.
</div>
<p><a name="suggest"><strong>Suggestions?</strong></a><br/>
 The utility of Arctos results from user input.
 If you have a suggestion to make, let's hear it.
 We accommodate many special requests through custom forms or custom queries,
 and many of these are then incorporated into Arctos.
Please <cfoutput><a href="mailto:#application.technicalEmail#">contact us</a></cfoutput> if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions.
