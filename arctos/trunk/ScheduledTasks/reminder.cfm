	<!------------------- loan ---------------->
	I propose the following, all only for loans where loan_status is not "closed" and return_due_date is not NULL, and all dependent on agents having email addresses and loans having useful contacts.

return_due_date - 30: send email to "notification contact"
return_due_date - 7: send email to "notification contact" and "in-house contact"
return_due_date: send email to  "notification contact" and "in-house contact"
return_due_date + 7: send email to "in-house contact" and collection's "loan request" contact
return_due_date + 30, and every 30-day anniversary thereof: send email to "in-house contact" and collection's "loan request" contact

And a proposal for a pleasant pre-due contact form, sent as HTML email from loan_notification@arctos.database.museum:

------------------------------
Dear {notification_contact.preferred_agent_name},

You are receiving this message because you are listed as a contact for loan {collection} {loan number}, which is due on {due date}.

Do not reply to this email. Contact {in-house contact preferred name} at {in-house contact email address} with any questions or concerns.

The nature of the loaned material is:

{nature_of_material}

Loaned specimen data, unless restricted, may be accessed at {URL to specimens involved in the loan}.
------------------------------



And angry past-due notice, sent only to in-house contact and collection's "loan request" agents, beginning at return_due_date + 7:

------------------------------
Dear {in-house contact and loan request agent},

You are receiving this message because loan {collection} {loan number} is {days past due} days past it's due date of {due date}.

If this loan has been extended or renewed, please update the loan status at {edit loan link that works for signed-in operators}.
------------------------------
