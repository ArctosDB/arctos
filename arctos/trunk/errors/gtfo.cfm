	Oops. It looks like you are on our blacklist. That's probably because someone from your IP
	made a lame attempt to hack us, or possibly we were just feeling exceptionally paranoid when you
	tried to do something legit, so you ended up in our logs anyway. We get like that sometimes, and we'd
	like to apologize now if you are neither a robot nor a hacker.
	<p>Use the form below to remove yourself from the blacklist. Leave us a note if you have any problems or if this is a recurring event.</p>
	<p>Sometimes the text gets messed up, so just click reload if you can't read it.</p>
