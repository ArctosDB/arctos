		The following table summarizes Arctos Operator Roles, and may be out of date. Please use the contact link in the footer if you notice errors.
		<br>The [def] link is the ONLY authoritative "description" of Arctos user roles. Note that roles are additive; "manage_geography" does NOT include SELECT 
		access to table geog_auth_rec; all users already have such access through the PUBLIC role.
		<br>
		<div class="importantNotification">
			Before assigning roles to users, provide them with the "required reading" link from the table below, and ensure that they 
			understand the responsibilities of working in a shared system.
