<h2>Catalog Data</h2>

"Catalog data" form the core of Arctos, and are roughly equivalent to the traditional data recorded with museum specimens.<br>
<br>
<div style=MARGIN-LEFT:40px>
  <b>Accessions </b>record groups of specimens coming into the Museum, and include agents, a description, and estimated specimen count.<b><br>
  <br>
  Collectors/Preparators:</b> Arctos records any number of agents acting as Collectors or Preparators.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Identifications:</b> Arctos records any number of identification determinations, only one of which may be accepted at any time. Identifications include any number of Agents, a data, and a method. Identifications are backed by formal taxonomy, but may consist of more than simply taxon names by way of formulae. Examples include:<br>

  <b>Locations</b> are split into several tables.<br>
</div>
<div style=MARGIN-LEFT:40px>
  <div style=MARGIN-LEFT:40px>
    <b>Higher Geography</b> is a formalized string which varies in specificity from continent to county.<br>
    <b>Locality</b> adds an interpreted locality description and vertical dimension.<br>
    <b>Coordinates</b> are recorded as determinations, of which only one may be accepted at any time. Coordinates include extensive information about precision and determination method, and may be recorded in any format.<br>
    <b>Collecting Event</b> adds a verbatim locality description, method and source, and habitat information.<br>
    <br>
  </div>
</div>
<div style=MARGIN-LEFT:40px>
  <b>Other Identifiers:</b> Any number of identifying "numbers" (consisting of strings, optionally split into prefix, integer 
	number, and suffix) may be recorded with a specimen. If corresponding data are available, as in GenBank and BOLD, 
	Other Identifiers may be structured to form external links.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Attributes</b> record measurements and determination. Any number of attributes may be recorded, and all attributes 
	include a method, a date, and a determiner. Attributes are collection-specific, and may use code-table controlled vocabularies. 
	Examples include:<br>

  <b>Parts</b> are the actionable units of Arctos. They are loaned, barcoded, and tracked. Cataloged Items are essentially 
	groups of parts. Parts may have a modifier, preservation method, disposition, condition, and may be scanned into 
	Containers.<br>

<h2>Usage</h2>

Arctos records specimen usage by way of Citations, which explicitly link Publications to Specimens.
