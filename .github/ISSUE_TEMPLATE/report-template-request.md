**Description of the report** - [Write a brief description of the report you need. Include link or name of previous report if migrating from a Cold Fusion report.]

**Collection for which the report is needed** - [Enter the GUID prefix of the requesting collection]

If this is a request to upgrade from an existing ColdFusion report in Arctos complete the following:

**SQL used in ColdFusion report** - copy the SQl from your old report and paste it here - begin and end it with ``` or it will be invisible. Let us know if there is a prefunction to migrate.

**Example records** - Use search to find a reasonable number of exemplary records for this label, ensure you've included guid_prefix (developers will have different collection access), then select "reload with sharable URL" in the tools menu and provide that link here.

**Priority** - [Please assign a priority so that the DBA knows whether there is any urgency associated with the new template}
