Download and populate the following CSV template to request geography.

[geog_template.csv](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/files/9145429/geog_template.csv)

Carefully read the documentation at https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/higher-geography.html before submitting a request.

spatial_footprint may be anything that can be made into ``geography`` data - WKT usually converts easiest. (Or ask for help - we have or can get spatial data for most geography-like places.)

search_terms is a pipe-delimited list of search terms; these are optional but recommended.
