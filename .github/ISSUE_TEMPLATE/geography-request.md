# Carefully read the documentation at https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/higher-geography.html before submitting a request.


### First Step: Explain what geography needs created.

Explain in sufficient detail for us to locate standardized spatial data. "County-level divisions of Some State, Some Country" or "whatever might be available for Some Country" is usually sufficient to start the process.

We will respond with a CSV template, or request more information.
