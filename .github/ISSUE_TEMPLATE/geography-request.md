Carefully read the documentation at https://handbook.arctosdb.org/documentation/higher-geography.html before submitting a request.

``spatial_footprint`` may be anything that can be made into ``geography`` data - WKT usually converts easiest. (Or ask for help - we have or can get spatial data for most geography-like places.)

``search_terms`` is a pipe-delimited list of search terms; these are optional but recommended.

``the_issue`` is the URL of the Issue in which the geography is requested (and discussed as necessary). This is required.
